"""Operator fare clearing (运营方票款清分).

A *first closing* (``POST /clearings``) freezes the half-open UTC settlement
window (on trip tap-out time ``ended_at``) and the per-station-pair operator
rules, reads every currently paired trip charge in the window, splits each
integer-cent amount by basis points (万分比, 10000 = 100%) and writes immutable
per-trip / per-operator ledger rows.

Indivisible cents left after floor division are handed out one each in
descending fractional remainder order; exact remainder ties are broken by
operator id ascending, so every split is total-preserving and deterministic.

*Adjustment batches* (``POST /clearings/adjustments``) always reference the
first closing: the window and rules stay frozen on the root batch. For each
trip currently in the window the target per-operator amount is split from the
*current* charge, the cumulative amount already booked for that
trip/operator across every earlier batch of the chain is subtracted, and only
the signed difference is appended. Trips that have disappeared (or left the
frozen window) are reversed to zero; trips whose station pair changed are
settled against the new pair, so old operators receive negative reversals and
new operators positive top-ups. Because each batch recomputes
``target - cumulative`` from scratch, repeating an adjustment (as an
idempotent replay or under a fresh batch id) books nothing twice.
